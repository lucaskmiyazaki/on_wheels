# On Wheels
This is a virtual reality shooter game powered by Unity designed to be played in a seated position. 
But, instead of walking and running, the player moves around by spinning a wheelchair (pressing trigger and pulling the wheel).
And, instead of shooting with a gun, the player has to hit enemies with a dodge ball.
